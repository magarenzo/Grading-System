# Grading System

Use a test menu to demo a grading system

## Instructions

You have been hired to develop a software system for displaying studentsâ€™ grades online. This system will be used by students, professors, and TAs. All types of users are required to log in upon accessing the system. Once logged in, the different users can do the following:

* Students will be able to view the grades for individual assignments for each of the courses they are taking. A student should not be able to gain access to grades of any other student.

* Professors and TAs will have access to the rosters for each of the courses they are teaching/grading. They will be able to enter grades for individual students for any of the assignments associated with the course.

* In addition, professors are able to add assignments to the course and remove assignments from the course. An assignment can be removed only if no grades have been entered for it. Also, professors can modify grades that have previously been entered (but TAs cannot; TAs can only enter new grades).

* The system must have a synchronization agent, capable of removing grades of students who drop out of a course and removing courses that are finished.
